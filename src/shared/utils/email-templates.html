      </p>
      <div class="do-dont-list">
        <h2>Do's:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Arrive Early: We recommend arriving at the airport/train station/bus
            terminal well in advance of your departure time. This will give you
            ample time to check in, clear security (if applicable), and relax
            before your journey.
          </li>
          <li>
            Travel Documents: Ensure you have all necessary travel documents,
            such as your passport, ticket, and any required visas. Double-check
            the expiration dates and keep them easily accessible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Baggage: Pack your bags efficiently and within the baggage weight
            limits. Label your luggage with your contact information and keep
            valuable items in your carry-on.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay Hydrated: It's essential to stay hydrated during your journey,
            so drink water regularly. Bring a reusable water bottle to fill up
            as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Entertainment: Bring entertainment such as books, magazines, or
            electronic devices to keep yourself occupied during the journey.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Don'ts:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't Overpack: Try to avoid packing unnecessary items that can make
            your baggage heavier and more cumbersome.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't Forget to Charge: Make sure your electronic devices are fully
            charged before leaving for the airport. Consider carrying a portable
            charger if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't Leave Valuables Unattended: Always keep an eye on your
            belongings, especially in public areas such as airports and train
            stations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't Forget COVID-19 Precautions: If traveling during the ongoing
            pandemic, follow all health and safety guidelines, including wearing
            a mask, practicing social distancing, and sanitizing your hands
            regularly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't Stress: Travel can be exciting but sometimes stressful. Try to
            stay calm and patient, and don't hesitate to ask our staff for
            assistance if needed.
